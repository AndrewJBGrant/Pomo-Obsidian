I wanted to Replicate my current setup of using a pomodoro timer, to-do list and Obsidian.

A practical way to learn the best practices of
### TypeScript
### Tailwind CSS
### React
### SupaBase
and testing libraries like **Jest** and **React** testing library
Using # Next.js allows me to work front and back end in **TypeScript** aswell as working with **RSC** (React server components)
I wanted to minimise the amount of npm packages used and instead work on coding as much as possible myself to get a better understanding of how JavaScript is working under the hood.

Trying to code a small markdown library.
